Worldpaint is for creating large swaths of things in EE on the fly.

CT is 'click temporary', and when you press C1/C2/C3, it copies the CT value to it.

Has tools for making:
-lines, squares, circles, spheres
of
-blackholes, mines, asteroids, nebulas

Also one-off planets. (making orbit commands is not in yet)


Also needs the utils.lua I've added things to. Will eventually be it's own fork.

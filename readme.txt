Copy scenario_sprs10_worldpaint.lua and utils.lua to your EE scripts folder

Worldpaint is for creating large swaths of things in EE on the fly.

Can be integrated into other scenarios fairly easily, read the instruction comments in the top of the lua file.

CT is 'click temporary', and when you press C1/C2/C3, it copies the CT value to it.

Has tools for making:
-lines, rows, squares, circles, spheres
of
-blackholes, mines, asteroids, nebulas

Also one-off planets. (making orbit commands is not in yet)


Also needs the utils.lua I've added things to. Will eventually be it's own fork.


Has the fleet spawner integrated.
